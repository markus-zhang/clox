"""
    A research script that demonstrates Pratt's parser:

    1. Very simple language
    - all tokens separated by whitespaces, even strings (no space allowed in strings, lol), so that I can simply call split()
    - Only supports float numbers
    - Operators:
        - Unary (only OP_NEG)
        - Binary(OP_ADD, OP_SUB, OP_MUL, OP_DIV)
        - Grouping

    2. REPL only, not scripts import allowed
    - And only allow a single line of input :)
